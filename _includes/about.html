                <h2>About My Changes</h2>
                <p>First off, I changed the color of the text throughout. I found the light gray to be a bit easier on the eyes.</p>
                <p>Second, I added a couple different elements for displaying content: Horizontal Elements, and Vertical Elements.</p>
                <p>This version of grayscale is brought to you by <a href='https://github.com/ajleonardi'>Anthony Leonardi</a> and it's based on the Jekyll version by <a href="https://github.com/jeromelachaud">Jerome Lachaud</a></p>
                <p>This theme features stock photos by <a href="http://gratisography.com/">Gratisography</a> along with a custom Google Maps skin courtesy of <a href="http://snazzymaps.com/">Snazzy Maps</a>.</p>
                <p>Grayscale includes full HTML, CSS, and custom JavaScript files along with LESS files for easy customization.</p>
